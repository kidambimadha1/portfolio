            <p>Back in 2013, I decided to try my hand at building a slam book using wordpress and tumbled head first
              into
              the coding and web development. The same year I've graduated as a Computer Science Major.
              I've landed a job, but as a suply chain
              support analyst. It's a huge corporation and my role was part of the support team for a new warehouse
              built. I went with the flow, but things did turn out good. I've had the opportunity to travel, meet and
              work with the business teams on-site. I understood the nuances and had grown on how to conduct oneself,
              and how documenting the process agreed upon and timely reporting of the changes are crucial for the
              communication. </p>

            <p>I still felt the developer bug and somehow being functional wasn't enough and wanted to be more in
              technical roles.
              I've taken the first chance that got me out and joined up a product company as a Manual tester. The urge
              to switch roles felt was far more than the role I intented to be in. It is here, I've
              continued to grow and learn more about SDLC process. I've started coding and was able to transition the
              roles and become an automation
              tester. This had got me the confidence and I've had pushed myself and landed the role of a software
              developer. </p>
            <p>
              The buzz around React had just started and I've found to give it a try and from
              then I've had deep dived into the world of web development. It's been more than 5+ years by now since I
              started to
              work with web world and it has been a learning curve and I continue to grow.</p>
            <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Capgemini. I enjoy
              building software that look good but also built well under the hood.
              When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually out enjoying a walk in the nature, listening to music or
              watching
              movies.</p>

                  diverse array of clients. All this while maintaining the build, style, and ship high-quality websites.
