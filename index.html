            <p>Back in 2013, I decided to try my hand at building a slam book using wordpress and tumbled head first
              into
              the coding and web development. As things happen, I've landed a job and started off as a suply chain
              support
              analyst and worked
              with a huge corporation, overlooking the support for a new warehouse. I've had the opportunity
              to travel, meet and work with the business teams at on-site.</p>
            <p>I still felt the developer bug and felt to switch roles and joined a product company. The urge to switch
              roles felt was far more than the role I intented to be in. So, I accepted the role of a tester. I've
              continued to grow and learn more about automation testing and switched roles again to become an automation
              tester. As things happen, the buzz around the React has started and I've found to give it a try and from
              then I've
              had deep dived into the world of web development. It's been more than 4+ years by now since I started to
              work with web world and it has been a learning and I continue to grow.</p>
            <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Capgemini. I enjoy
              building software that look good but also built well under the hood.
              When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually out enjoying a walk in the nature, listening to music or
              watching
              movies.</p>

                  diverse array of clients. All this while maintaining the build, style, and ship high-quality websites.
