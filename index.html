          <p>Back in 2013, I decided to try my hand at building a slam book using wordpress and tumbled head first into
            the coding and web development. As things happen, I've landed a job and started off as a suply chain support
            analyst and worked
            with a huge corporation, overlooking the support for a new warehouse. I've had the opportunity
            to travel, meet and work with the business teams at on-site.</p>
          <p>I still felt the developer bug and felt to switch roles and joined a product company. The urge to switch
            roles felt was far more than the role I intented to be in. So, I accepted the role of a tester. I've
            continued to grow and learn more about automation testing and switched roles again to become an automation
            tester.</p>
          <p>As things happen, the buzz around the React has started and I've found to give it a try and from then I've
            had deep dived into the world of web development. It's been more than 4+ years by now since I started to
            work with web world and it has been a learning and I continue to grow.</p>
          <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Capgemini. I enjoy
            building software that look good but also built well under the hood. </p>
          <p>When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually out enjoying a walk in the nature, listening to music or watching
            movies.</p>
